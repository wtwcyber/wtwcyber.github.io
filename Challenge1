1. Hey, so I have code, but I need to know how much code I have. Can you tell me? I keep all of my libraries in the vendor/ folder and I don’t care about their code. ok thx
NOTE: Answer is the number of lines of code
2. I put a flag in a file so I wouldn’t lose it, but then I lost it. Can you find it pls?
3. I am having a google problem and it is a very bad time. Maybe you can help? I will pay in flags.
4. My friend made an account, but I think I lost it. Can you tell me the name? Thanks!
5. I think I had some media somewhere? Anyway, it would be nice if you could find it and not tell my parents.
6. Someone told me I had some packages on my computer, but I’m not really sure how many. Maybe you can tell me?
7. My friend said that if I log on to his computer he’ll give me a flag. Maybe he’ll give one to you, too? Oh yeah, he said his address was “G 0xa3 ! 0x16”. Maybe you should go there.
